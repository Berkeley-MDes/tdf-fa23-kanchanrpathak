# Particle Photon 2 Microcontroller

### Parts that comprise a microcontroller:

*Processor*: contains all the circuitry needed to process input, store data, and output results
*RAM*: for storing data temporarily
*ROM*: storing programs that hold instructions to trigger various events
*Program counter*: allows the microcontroller to execute commands based on the programmed code
*I/O*: consist of digital and analog I/O pins, servo motor controllers, and any number of connectors for adding peripherals

Difference between MCU and SBC
*Single-board computer:*
- Runs an operating system with programs running on top of that
- Capable of multi-tasking

*Microcontroller:*
- Runs one program
- Executes a singular task
