## What is Computational Design?

Traditionally, design is passive—a designer uses their knowledge and intuition to create designs with a computer-aided design (CAD) program. This method of manual drafting limits the number of design options that can be considered and is restricted by available time and resources.

Computational design is a design method that uses a combination of algorithms and parameters to solve design problems with advanced computer processing. Every step of a designer’s process is translated into coded computer language. The software program uses this information alongside project-specific parameters to create algorithms that generate design models or complete design analyses. Once the initial programming is completed, design becomes a dynamic and repeatable process.

Once implemented, computational design is an effective and useful tool for increasing productivity and creating more robust designs.

## Understanding Rhino

I tried to understand the function blocks in Grasshopper and their effect on the final output in Rhino. Was interested in 3D model so went forward with understanding the code for the 3D model.

The final product



I tried to understand the 3D printing first by making basic changes to the original design and then got back to Rhino to explore more and get a new design for the print.

More coming here...
