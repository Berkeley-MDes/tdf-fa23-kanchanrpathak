Learning - Can not link knowledge with message from bot
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
Learning - Need to tweak instructions so that it doesn't give a standard response from bot. Instead we need customised response.
<br>
<br>

<br>
Learning - It's asking two questions using "or" when I needed it to ask only one of them
<br>
<br>
<br>

Worked! Also I added instructions for only limited number of attempts
<br>

<br>
Concern - Sometimes it took a long amounts of time even to type out simple responses. 
<br>
<br>

<br>
Learning - Sometimes it displayed user the instructions that I used to train the model privately. Needed to add more constraints.
<br>
<br>

<br>
It did not link my expectation variable with the model to suggest the comfort activities.

<br>
Learning -  can not use the valiables more than once in the instruction or it just shows up as text.
