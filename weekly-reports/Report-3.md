## Why this Design Decision?

- **Why 3D Printing?** - 3D Printed objects are more popular in this contemporary world.  (Also I wanted to understand how 3D Printers work)

- **Why white color?** - White gives a feeling of minimalism and looks more aesthetic since white color stands for pure and simplicity. White also causes less distraction, which means more attention on the content of the phone screen.

- **Why this particular size?** - The stand is tweaked in such a way that it's stable to bear the phone's weight and works for both horizontal and vertical orientation of the phone

It's still a *WIP*, my process was - I tried to understand the 3D printing first by making basic changes to the original design and then got back to Rhino to explore more and get a new design for the print.

More coming here...
