# Project - Musical Installation

Idea - We propose an immersive way of transforming the steep process of learning music into a fun filled experience! It will be an innovative interactive hardware project that combines water, touch sensitivity, and gesture recognition to create a unique musical experience. Colorful trigger objects and various sets of hand motion in water results in production of musical patterns that can not only make learning music fun, but also a wholesome experience to the audience.
