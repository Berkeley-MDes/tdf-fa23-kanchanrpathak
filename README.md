# [Project 2 - Report 2](weekly-reports/P2_Report-2.md)

This week tried to play with the LEDs and photoresistor. Also tried connective Photon2 with p5.js using URL that refers to the device ID and Access token.

# [Project 2 - Report 1](weekly-reports/P2_Report-1.md)

This week I tried to understand and read about all the material that was provided in the kit and was able to set up the Photon 2 for Berkeley IOT Wi-Fi.

# [Report 4 - Week of 09/14/2023](weekly-reports/Report-4.md)

In week 4, with a decent understanding of how to make a computational model in Grasshopper + Rhino, I wanted to use this newly acquired skill to make some curvy pots!


I chose 3D printing for the project due to its versatility and ability to create custom and intricate designs. I chose white for print as White is often associated with minimalism and simplicity, which can lend a clean and modern look to your design.

# [Report 3 - Week of 09/07/2023](weekly-reports/Report-3.md)

In week 3, I understood what was going on in the grasshopper-rhino ecosystem. I tried to go one step forward. I tried to understand the computation model in Grasshopper better by changing the parameters to redesign the stand according to my needs.

I tweaked the parameters so that it works for both horizontal and vertical phone orientations and ensures the stability of the phone.

# [Report 2 - Week of 08/31/2023](weekly-reports/Report-2.md)

In week 2, we learned about what a computational design is and how it is an effective and useful tool for increasing productivity and creating more robust designs. 

I explored the Rhino and Grasshopper combination. I learned how to bake with Grasshopper and export the object in STL format suitable for 3D printing. I also got the chance to use Cura to slice the object for compatibility with the Prusa printers and generated the basic 3D printed phone stand.

# Example Report 1 - Week of 08/24/2023 #
This week, I designed a cool phone stand made of rocks. Check out all my cool sketches and progress photos from this week below, etc., etc....

Either way, it's time to start making this space your own! If you want to save these instructions -- Don't worry, I already copied them over to another file for you [here.](welcomeREADME.md) So feel empowered to delete everything in this README.md and start documenting! 

sparkles,

your TDF TA, shm :sparkles:

PS: let me know if you have any questions!!

# Hello DES INV 202 Student!
Welcome to your new GitHub repository! 

If you‚Äôre new to GitHub, you can think of this as a shared file space (like a Google Drive folder, or a like a USB drive that‚Äôs hosted online.) 

This is your space to store project files, videos, PDFs, notes, images, etc., and (hopefully, neatly) organize so it's easy for viewers (and you!) to navigate. That said, it‚Äôs super easy for you to share any file or folder with us (your TDF instructional team) - just send us the link! 

The specific file that I‚Äôm typing into right now is the **README.md** for this repo. 
##### (üí° TIP: The .md indicates that we‚Äôre using [Markdown formatting.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)) #####
<h6> (üí° TIP 2: GitHub Markdown supports <a href="https://gist.github.com/seanh/13a93686bf4c2cb16e658b3cf96807f2"> <em>HTML formatting</em> too, including emojis üòÑ</a>, in case that helps!) </h6>

### :star: Whatever you write in your **README.md** will show up on the ‚Äúfront page‚Äù of your GitHub repo. This is where we‚Äôll be looking for your [weekly progress reports](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/desinv-202/wiki/3.0-Weekly-Submissions). They might look something like this: ###
